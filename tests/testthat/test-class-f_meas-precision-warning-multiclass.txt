While computing multiclass `precision()`, some levels had no predicted events (i.e. `true_positive + false_positive = 0`). 
Precision is undefined in this case, and those levels will be removed from the averaged result.
Note that the following number of true events actually occured for each problematic event level:
'c': 1
