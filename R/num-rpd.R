#' Ratio of performance to deviation
#'
#' These functions are appropriate for cases where the model outcome is a
#' numeric. The ratio of performance to deviation
#' ([rpd()]) and the ratio of performance to inter-quartile ([rpiq()])
#' are both measures of consistency/correlation between observed
#' and predicted values (and not of accuracy).
#'
#' In the field of spectroscopy in particular, the ratio
#' of performance to deviation (RPD) has been used as the standard
#' way to report the quality of a model. It is the ratio between
#' the standard deviation of a variable and the standard error of
#' prediction of that variable by a given model. However, its
#' systematic use has been criticized by several authors, since
#' using the standard deviation to represent the spread of a
#' variable can be misleading on skewed dataset. The ratio of
#' performance to inter-quartile has been introduced by
#' Bellon-Maurel et al. (2010) to address some of these issues, and
#' generalise the RPD to non-normally distributed variables.
